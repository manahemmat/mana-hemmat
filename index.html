    Geography
</h2>
<p>
    Shiraz is located in the south of Iran and the northwest of Kerman Province.
    It is built in a green plain at the foot of the Zagros Mountains 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) above sea level.
    Shiraz is 800 kilometres (500 mi) south of Tehran.

<h2 id="gardens">
    Gardens
</h2>
<p>
    Shiraz contains a considerable number of gardens. Due to population growth in the city, many of these gardens
    may be lost to give way to new developments. Although some measures have been taken
    by the Municipality to preserve these gardens, many illegal developments still endanger them

    Culture
</h2>
<p>
    Shiraz is known as the city of poets, gardens, wine, nightingales and flowers. The crafts of Shiraz consist of
    inlaid mosaic work of triangular design; silver-ware; carpet-weaving, and the making of the rugs called gilim
    and "jajim" in the villages and among the tribes.
</p>

<p>
    The garden is an important part of Iranian culture. There are many old gardens in Shiraz such as the Eram garden and
    the
    Afif abad garden. According to some people, Shiraz "disputes with Xeres [or Jerez] in Spain the honour of being
    the birthplace of sherry." Shirazi wine originates from the city; however, under the current Islamic regime, liquor
    cannot be consumed except by religious minorities.
</p>

<p>
    Shiraz is proud of being mother land of Hafiz Shirazi, Shiraz is a center for Iranian culture and has produced a
    number of famous poets.
